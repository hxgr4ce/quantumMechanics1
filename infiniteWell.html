            <h1>Infinite Potential Well</h1>
            Say that we have a particle moving in one dimension with the following potential:
            \[V(x)=
            \begin{cases}
                \infty & x \lt 0 \cap x \gt L \\

            This is our <a href="finiteWell.html">finite well</a> scenario where \(\lim_{V_0\to\infty}\) (and is also called the particle in the box scenario).
            Evidently, this is not as realistic as the finite well, but it (according to Wikipedia) "describes the movement of a free particle in a small space surrounded by impenetrable barriers. 
            The model is mainly used as a hypothetical example to illustrate the differences between classical and quantum systems".
            <br><br>
            In the locations where \(V_0=\infty\), the potential becomes infinitely repelling, meaning that a particle is incredibly unlikely to be found there; in fact, it is impossible.
            This means that in these regions (where \(x\lt 0\) and \(x \gt L\)), the wavefunction (and its squared modulus) must be 0, and there cannot be continuity at these boundaries.
            We are now working not in \(L^2(\mathbb{R})\), but in \(L^2([0,L])\).
            This leads to a couple problems, which we will mention later...
            <br><br>
            What are the eigenstates of \(\hat H\)?
            We have the condition that \(\psi(0) = \psi(L) = 0\), and that \(\psi'(0^+) \neq 0, \psi'(L^-) \neq 0\).
            As before, we start with \(\hat H|\psi\rangle = E|\psi\rangle\) and add \(\langle x|\), so we see it in the Schroedinger representation (or position-space representation, as we're just looking at the operators/states in the position basis).
            Thus we have the following:
            <!-- \[\begin{cases}
                -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \psi(x) = E\psi(x) \\
                \psi(0) = \psi(L) = 0
            \end{cases}\] -->
            \[\begin{align}
                \langle x|\hat H|\psi\rangle &= \langle x|E|\psi\rangle \\
                -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2}{dx^2} \psi(x) &= E\psi(x) \\
                \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \psi(x) &= -\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} E\psi(x) \\
                \psi^"(x) &= -\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} E\psi(x) \\
                \psi^"(x) + \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} E\psi(x) &= 0 \\
                \text{Say } k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}} \text{:  }
                \psi^"(x) + k^2\psi(x) &= 0
            \end{align}\]
            which has the solution
            \[\psi = A\sin(kx) + B\cos(kx)\]
            This is the same solution that we got for the finite well, scenario II.
            <br><br>
            Because \(\psi(0)=0\), and \(\cos(0) \neq 0\), we have to set \(B=0\).
            Because \(\psi(L)=0\), we need to make \(A\sin(kL)=0\) without setting \(A=0\) (else we would have a 0 vector which cannot be an eigenvector by definition).
            Thus, we say that \(kL = n\pi, k_n = \frac{n\pi}{L}\).
            \(n \neq 0\) lest we get the zero vector, and note that \(\sin(-x) = -\sin(x)\), so a negative value of \(n\) gives us no new information that we got from positive \(n\); their squared moduli both describe the same probability distribution.
            We can then define \(n\in\mathbb{N} = 1, 2, \cdots\).
            <br><br>
            Now, \(\psi_n(x) = A_n\sin(k_nx) = A_n\sin(\frac{n\pi}{L} x), n\in\mathbb{N}\).
            We still need to determine what \(A\) is, however, which we do as follows:
            \[\begin{align}
                1 &= \langle \psi_n | \psi_n \rangle \\
                &= \int_0^L (A_n\sin(\frac{n\pi}{L} x))^*(A_n\sin(\frac{n\pi}{L} x)) dx \\
                &= \int_0^L A_n^2\sin^2(\frac{n\pi}{L} x) dx \\
                &= A_n^2 \int_0^L \sin^2(\frac{n\pi}{L} x) dx  = A_n^2 \frac{1}{2}\big[x - \frac{L}{2n\pi}\sin(\frac{2n\pi}{L}x) \big]_0^L \\
                &= A_n^2 \frac{1}{2}(L - \frac{L}{2n\pi}\sin(2n\pi) - \frac{L}{2n\pi}\sin(0) ) \\
                1 &= A_n^2\frac{L}{2} \\
                A_n &= \sqrt{\frac{L}{2}}
            \end{align}\]
            giving us the final solution that \(\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{L}{2}}\sin(\frac{n\pi}{L} x), n\in\mathbb{N}\)
            <br><br>
            Previously we defined \(k = \sqrt{\frac{2mE}{\hbar^2}}\), and now we know that \(k_n = \frac{n\pi}{L}\), so we can define energy eigenvalue \(E_n\) as:
            \[\begin{align}
                \sqrt{\frac{2mE_n}{\hbar^2}} &= \frac{n\pi}{L} \\
                \frac{2mE_n}{\hbar^2} &= \frac{n^2\pi^2}{L^2} \\
                E_n &= \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2} = \frac{\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2} n^2 \\
            \end{align}\]
            and since \(\frac{\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}\) is simply some constant value, we can say that \(E_n\) increases quadratically with \(n\).
            <p>We also know that for a fixed \(n\), eigenstate \(\psi(x)\) is a sinusoid that looks like the following:</p>

            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Fig 1. From left to right, \(\psi(x)\) for \(n=1, n=2, n=3,\) and \(n=4\).</i></p>
            Notice how the number of nodes increases linearly with \(n\), and that states are alternatingly even or odd!
            We could have seen this right off the bat, if we had chosen to center our infinite well around 0 instead of \(\frac{L}{2}\), in which case the parity operator \(\hat \Pi\) commutes with \(\hat H\), and we can follow the same line of reasoning that we did for the finite potential well.
            <br><br>
            Additionally, each \(n\) produces one unique eigenvalue, since we said \(n\in\mathbb{N}\), and one unique \(\psi(x)\), indicating that these states are non-degenerate.
            We can then write
            \[\hat H = \sum_{\lambda \in \sigma(\hat H)}\lambda\hat P_\lambda = \sum_{n=1}^\infty E_n|\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n|\]
            \[\hat U(t) = e^{-i\hat H t/\hbar} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-iE_n t/\hbar} |\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n|\]
            which makes it apparent that at very special times, \(e^{-iE_n t/\hbar} = 1\).
            If we define the time \(T=\frac{4mL^2}{\pi\hbar}\), then the exponent becomes
            \[-iE_n t/\hbar = -iE_n \frac{4mL^2}{\pi\hbar}/\hbar = -i \frac{\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2} n^2 \frac{4mL^2}{\pi\hbar}/\hbar = -i 2\pi n^2 \]
            Clearly, \(e^{-i 2\pi n^2} = {e^{i \pi }}^{-2n^2} = (-1)^{-2n^2} = 1^{-n^2} = 1 \), so
            \[\hat U(T) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty e^{-iE_n T/\hbar} |\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n|= \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n| = \hat 1\]
            which means that at very special times, the state evolves back to the original state! 
            This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_revival">revival</a>.
            <br><br>
            A little more about the dynamics of this system:
            \(|\psi_n\rangle\) are <a href="dynamics.html#stationary">stationary states</a>, but the system can also be in a linear combination of states \(\sum_n c_n |\psi_n\rangle\), which means it moves around/evolves as time passes.
            Say that we have initial state:
            \[|\psi(t=0)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} (|\psi_1\rangle + |\psi_2\rangle)\]
            whose wavefunction looks a little like the following:
            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                <img style="width: 23%;" src="images/comboinit.png">
            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Fig 2. \(\psi_1(x)\) (blue), \(\psi_2(x)\) (red) and \(\psi(x) = \psi_1(x)+\psi_2(x)\) (purple).</i></p>
            Notice that we no longer have an even or odd function: the wavefunction peaks more on the left side of the box than the right, indicating that the particle is more likely to be on the left side of the box.
            At some time \(t\), this system will be in state:
            \[
                |\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}e^{-iE_nt\hbar} (|\psi_1\rangle + e^{-i\omega_{21}t}|\psi_2\rangle)
            \]
            And, if this time \(t\) is specifically \(\frac{\pi}{\omega_{21}}\), then 
            \[\begin{align}
                |\psi(t)\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}e^{-iE_nt\hbar} (|\psi_1\rangle + e^{-i\pi}|\psi_2\rangle) \\
                &= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}e^{-iE_nt\hbar} (|\psi_1\rangle - |\psi_2\rangle)
            \end{align}\]
            where \(e^{-iE_nt\hbar}\) is some scalar value.
            At this point, the wave function would look approximately like:
            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                <img style="width: 23%;" src="images/combolater.png">

            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Fig 3. \(\psi_1(x)\) (blue), \(\psi_2(x)\) (red) and \(\psi_1(x)-\psi_2(x)\) (purple).</i></p>
            which is clearly skewed more to the right than the left, now.
            Intuitively, we understand this change as a result of the particle bouncing back and forth off of the sides of the box.
            <br><br>
            We now discuss the expectation values for such a state after some time \(t\) has passed.
            \[\begin{align}
                \langle\hat x\rangle_{\psi(t)} &= \frac{1}{2} (\langle\psi_1| + e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2|) \hat x (|\psi_1\rangle + e^{-i\omega_{21}t}|\psi_2\rangle) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2} (\langle\psi_1|\hat x |\psi_1\rangle + e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle + \langle\psi_1|\hat x e^{-i\omega_{21}t}|\psi_2\rangle + e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2| \hat x  e^{-i\omega_{21}t}|\psi_2\rangle) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2} (\langle\psi_1|\hat x |\psi_1\rangle + e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle + e^{-i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_1| \hat x |\psi_2\rangle + \langle\psi_2| \hat x |\psi_2\rangle) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2} (\frac{L}{2} + e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle + (e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle)^* + \frac{L}{2} ) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2} (L + 2Re\{e^{i\omega_{21}t} \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle\}) \\
                &= \frac{1}{2} (L + 2\langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle \cos(\omega_{21}t)) \\
                &= \frac{L}{2} + \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle \cos(\omega_{21}t) \\
            \end{align}\]
            The term \(\langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle\) is the matrix element that is equal to:
            \[\begin{align}
                \langle\psi_2|\hat x|\psi_1\rangle &= \int_{0}^L dx \langle\psi_2|\hat x|x\rangle\langle x|\psi_1\rangle \\
                &= \int_{0}^L \int_{0}^L dx dx' \langle\psi_2|x'\rangle\langle x'|\hat x|x\rangle\langle x|\psi_1\rangle \\
                &= \int_{0}^L \int_{0}^L dx dx' \psi_2(x') x\langle x'|x\rangle \psi_1(x) \\
                &= \int_{0}^L dx \psi_2(x) x \psi_1(x) \\
                &= \int_{0}^L dx \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin(\frac{2\pi}{L}x) x \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin(\frac{\pi}{L}x) \\
                &= \frac{2}{L}\int_{0}^L dx x \sin(\frac{2\pi}{L}x) \sin(\frac{\pi}{L}x) \\
            \end{align}\]
            though, I'm not going to work the whole thing out...
            <br><br>
            Finally, in this scenario, \(\hat H^{-1}\) is also well-defined:
            \[\hat H^{-1} = \sum \frac{1}{E_n}|\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n|\]
            and has the same eigenstates as \(\hat H\), however, its discrete eigenvalues vary as \(\frac{1}{n^2}\), and so converge, rather than diverge.
            this means that \(\hat H^{-1}\) is a compact operator, and it is the simplest case where you can demonstrate the spectral theorem.
            <hr>
            <p>As mentioned before, there are a few problems with the particle in a box scenario.
            Say that we have some arbitrary \(\psi(x)\), pictured below, and we want to know the probability of finding a particle within the interval \([a,b]\).</p>
            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
                <img style="width: 23%;" src="images/arb.png">

            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Fig 4. Some arbitrary \(\psi(x)\) (purple), and \(x=a\) and \(x=b\) for some arbitrary \(a\) and \(b\) (orange).</i></p>
            From our <a href="qmPostulates.html">quantum postulates</a>, we know that this is (for a normalized \(\psi(x)\))
            \(\langle \psi | \hat P_{[a,b]}|\psi\rangle\)
            where the (position space) projector is
            \(\hat P_{[a,b]} = \int_a^b dx|x\rangle\langle x|\).
            Then, the probability is \(\int_a^b dx |\psi(x)|^2\).
            <br><br>
            But what is the state of the system after this measurement?
            \[|\psi\rangle \to |\psi'\rangle = \hat P_{[a,b]}|\psi\rangle\]
            \[\psi'(x) = \langle x |\int_a^b dx'|x'\rangle\langle x'|\psi\rangle = \int_a^b dx'\delta(x-x') \langle x'|\psi\rangle \]
            If we're evaluating \(\psi'(x)\) at \(x\notin [a,b]\), then the entire integral comes out to 0.
            If \(x\in [a,b]\), then we have \(\langle x'|\psi\rangle\), so simply \(\psi(x)\).
            This means that our wavefunction now looks like this!
            \[\psi'(x) = 
                \begin{cases}
                    0 & x\notin[a,b]\\
                    \psi(x) & x\in[a,b]
                \end{cases}
            \]

            </div>
            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Fig 5. The "truncated" function after measurement.</i></p>
            Now the function is discontinuous on \([0,L]\), and not in the domain of \(\hat H\) anymore!
            If we want to, we can still find the expectation value:
            \[\begin{align}
                \frac{\langle\hat H\rangle_{\psi'}}{\langle\psi'|\psi'\rangle} &= \frac{\sum_{n=0}^\infty E_n | \langle\psi_n|\psi_n\rangle | ^2}{\int_a^b|\psi|^2 dx}
            \end{align}\]
            as \(E_n\) is proportional to \(n^2\), it diverges faster than \(| \langle\psi_n|\psi_n\rangle | ^2\), which means that the entire thing diverges; the measurement puts the system into a state with infinite energy.
            You could even attempt to use the time evolution operator on it (as unitary \(\hat U(t)\) is defined everywhere), but we would get stuck at \(|\psi'(t)\rangle = \sum_n e^{-i\hat H t/\hbar |\psi_n\rangle\langle\psi_n\psi'\rangle}\) because we can't apply the \(\langle x|\) to represent in the position basis, for Schoedinger's representation.
            In summary, things get a little tricky, and the quantum postulates are somewhat idealistic, but it seems like we don't talk about that until Quantum Mechanics 2...

            The next problem is this:
            We know that the momentum operator in the position basis is \(\langle x|\hat p = -i\hbar\frac{d}{dx}\langle x|\).
            <i>This is not an observable anymore</i>.
            Say that we have function \(\phi\) and state \(\psi\). Then, if we integrate by parts:
            \[\begin{align}
                \langle\phi|\hat p|\psi\rangle &= \int_0^L -i\hbar \phi^*\frac{d}{dx}\psi dx = -i\hbar\big[\phi^*(x)\psi(x)\big]_0^L + i\hbar\int_0^L\psi \frac{d}{dx}\phi^* dx \\
                &= -i\hbar\big[\phi^*(x)\psi(x)\big]_0^L + (-i\hbar\int_0^L \psi^* \frac{d}{dx}\phi dx)^* \\
                &= -i\hbar\big[\phi^*(x)\psi(x)\big]_0^L + \langle\psi|\hat p|\phi\rangle^* \\
            \end{align}\]
            We know that any state must satisfy the boundary conditions that \(\psi(0)=\psi(L)=0\), so \(-i\hbar\big[\phi^*(x)\psi(x)\big]_0^L = 0\).
            Thus we have that \(\langle\phi|\hat p|\psi\rangle = \langle\psi|\hat p|\phi\rangle^*\) which means the adjoint of \(\hat p\) <i>is</i> defined, but recall that to be <i>self</i>-adjoint, an operator needs to have the same domain as its adjoint.
            <br><br>
            The domain of \(\hat p\) is defined by \(|\psi\rangle\) (since we do \(\hat p|\psi\rangle\)... \(|\psi\rangle\) is the input to \(\hat p\)), which is in \(L^2([0,L])\) <i>only</i>. 
            But the domain of \(\hat p^\dagger\) is defined by \(|\phi\rangle\), which is not restricted at all (it just needs to be continuous and square integrable on \([0,L]\)).
            It follows that the domain of \(\hat p^\dagger\) is broader than the domain of \(\hat p\).
            This is an example of an operator being <i>Hermitian but not self-adjoint</i>.
            <br><br>
            Physically you may be able to gain an intuition for this by thinking about the <a href="qmDefs.html#ops">eigenstates of \(\hat p\)</a>. 
            Recall that these are (in the position basis) \(\frac{e^{ipx/\hbar}}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}}\).
            If we want our system to be in an eigenstate of position, then, we need to satisfy the boundary conditions so \(\frac{e^{ip0/\hbar}}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} = \frac{e^{ipL/\hbar}}{\sqrt{2\pi\hbar}} = 0 \)
            This is clearly impossible, since the exponential function alone never equals 0.
            Because it is impossible to be in a momentum eigenstate, it is impossible to measure momentum.
            (Note that this is not the case for the <i>finite</i> potential well, though.)
            <br><br>
            Similarly, the translation operator \(\hat T_{\Delta x}\) is not unitary anymore, either, because it can shift a (position) wavefunction completely outside of \([0,L]\), which is not allowed...
            As a result it is not surjective, and so it is not unitary.
