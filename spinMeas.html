        We know that if we filter a beam of silver atoms to only contain \(\mid+\rangle\) atoms, then observe the spin along the \(x\) axis, we see that the filtered beam is split evenly into two, as in <i>Fig 1b</i>.
        We can say that the probability of observing a certain physical quantity is the norm squared of the corresponding state after measurement, which comes from our <a href="qmPostulates.html">quantum postulates</a>.
        <br><br>
        We are absolutely certain that the atoms in the incoming beam to the second magnetic field are in state \(\mid+\rangle\). In our case, we can say that this probability is normalized to 1, since we filtered the beam to guarantee that all remaining atoms are in this state.
        (Still, the length of \(\mid+\rangle\) is 1 anyway, so the norm squared is 1 anyway...)
        <br><br>
        What is the state of the atoms in the beam after we pass it through the second magnetic field, oriented in the \(x\) direction?
        We don't know! All we can say is that, from quantum postulates, the probability of an atom being in state \(\mid S_x\pm\rangle\) is:
        \[\begin{align}
            \frac{||\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid+\rangle||^2}{||\mid+\rangle||^2} &= ||\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid+\rangle||^2 \\
            & = (\langle+\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm)(\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid+\rangle) \\
            & = \langle+\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid+\rangle \\
            & = \langle+\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid+\rangle \\
            &= |\langle+\mid S_x\pm\rangle|^2
        \end{align}\]
        After substituting in for the state \(\mid S_x\pm\rangle\):
        \[\begin{align}
            \frac{||\mid S_x\pm\rangle\langle S_x\pm\mid+\rangle||^2}{||\mid+\rangle||^2} &= |\langle+\mid S_x\pm\rangle|^2 \\
            &= |\langle+\mid(\frac{\mid+\rangle\pm\mid-\rangle}{\sqrt2})|^2 \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}|\langle+\mid(\mid+\rangle\pm\mid-\rangle)|^2 \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}|\langle+\mid+\rangle\pm\langle+\mid-\rangle|^2 \\
            &= \frac{1}{2}|1+0|^2 = \frac{1}{2}
        \end{align}\]
        So all we can say is that there is an equal chance of an incoming atom being in state \(\mid S_x, + \rangle\) or \(\mid S_x,-\rangle\), <i>even though we prepared each atom to be in the exact same initial state</i>.
        Since this probabilty is well-defined, but the outcome for each individual atom is truly random, the measurement of spin along a certain axis is truly a stochastic process.
