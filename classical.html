        <h1>A Crash Course on Classical Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics</h1>
        In undergraduate physics, you mostly stay in the realm of Netwonian physics, and may briefly touch on Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics.
        You study these more in depth in graduate school, but I quite haven't had the time to go to grad school for physics yet, so this will have to be good enough...
        <h2>Newtonian Mechanics</h2>
        The general process for Newtonian mechanics is to:
        <ol>
            <li>Describe all <b><i>forces</i></b> acting on an object.</li>
            <li>Use \(\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\) to describe the acceleration, and by extension the velocity and position of the object over time.</li>
        </ol>
        For example, the motion of the bob on a pendulum as depicted below has acceleration \(\ddot\theta = -\frac{g}{l}sin\theta\).
        (The two dots in \(\ddot\theta\) indicate that \(\theta\) is a function with respect to time, and \(\ddot\theta\) is the second derivative of this function.)

        As you can imagine, \(\ddot\theta\) describes the acceleration of the bob over time.
        <h2 id="lagra">Lagrangian Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
            The general process for Lagrangian mechanics is to:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Describe all <b><i>energies</i></b> corresponding to an object as the <b><i>Lagrangian</i></b>: 
                    \[L=K-U\]
                    where \(K\) is kinetic energy and \(U\) is potential energy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use <b><i>the Euler-Lagrange equation</i></b> to obtain the equation of motion:
                    \[\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q}\]
                    where \(q\) is a singular coordinate (for example the position of a particle along the \(x\) axis, or the angle a pendulum makes with the vertical).
                </li>
            </ol>
            In our pendulum example, say \(s\) is the arc length travelled by the bob from the vertical so that \(s = l\theta\).
            (Note that \(\theta\) is a function of time \(t\)!!)
            \(\dot{s}\) then represents the velocity of the bob at \(t\).
            <br><br>
            Also say that \(y=0\) is at the height of the pivot and anything below it is in the negative direction.
            We can determine the Lagrangian by doing:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    K &= \frac{1}{2}m\vec{v^2}
                    = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{s}^2 \\
                    &= \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 \\
                    U &= -mglcos\theta \\
                    L &= \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 + mgl\cdot cos\theta
                \end{align}
            \]
            Then the Euler-Lagrange equation for this particular situation is:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    ml^2\ddot\theta = -mgl\cdot sin\theta
                \end{align}
            \]
            which, with a little rearranging, will recover the same equation of motion that we obtained before:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    ml^2\ddot\theta &= -mglsin\theta \\
                    l\ddot\theta &= -gsin\theta \\
                    \ddot\theta &= -\frac{g}{l}sin\theta
                \end{align}
            \]
            Note that the Euler-Lagrange equation mirrors the Newtonian \(\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\): 
            Generally, if \(L = \frac{1}{2} m \dot{q^2} - U(q)\), then \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial {q}} = -\frac{\partial U}{\partial q} = \vec{F}\).
            Furthermore, \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = m\dot{q}, \frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = m\ddot{q} = m\vec{a}\), so we end up with \(\vec{F}=m\vec{a}\) again.
            The Euler-Lagrange equation simply generalizes this relationship so that it applies to any coordinate system.

            <h2>I talk about things I don't fully understand</h2>
            Lagrangian mechanics is based on the "principle of stationary action". 
            Say that a system has a coordinate \(q\) that changes with time.
            Each section of the path that \(q\) traverses has an associated energy, and the system spends some amount of time in that section.
            <br><br>
            An action is defined then as:
            \[S(q(t)) = \int L(q, \dot q, t) dt\]
            (With units of \(\text{energy}\cdot\text{time}\)... The same as Planck's constant \(h\) and \(\hbar\)...)
            <br><br>
            In other words, for each path of coordinate \(q\) over time \(t\), there is an associated action \(S\) which describes how "costly" that path is, in terms of energy and time.
            <br><br>
            This principle says that a system will choose a path where, <i>even if the path varies slightly</i>, the action does not change.
            So, the paths chosen have actions that are on extrema-- minimums, maximums, or saddle points-- of the action function.
            <br><br>
            Applying this concept to our above equation for \(S(q(t))\) is what yields the Euler-Lagrange equation.
            <br><br>
            This means that instead of the defining concept being "force causes acceleration" as in Newtonian mechanics, the defining concept is "motion abides by extremal action".
        </p>
        <h2 id="ham">Hamiltonian Mechanics</h2>
        The general process for Hamiltonian mechanics is to:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Describe all <b><i>energies</i></b> corresponding to an object as the <b><i>Hamiltonian</i></b>: 
                \[H=p\dot{q}-L\]
                where \(p\) is momentum and \(L\) is the Lagrangian. 
                <br>
                (Also, occasionally this will look like \(H=K+U\), or the total energy of the system!)
            </li>
            <li>
                From \(p = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}}\), you can write \(\dot{q}\) in terms of p, then plug this into the Hamiltonian-- you want the Hamiltonian to be in terms of variables \(p\) and \(\theta\).
            </li>
            <li>
                Use <b><i>Hamilton's equations</i></b> to obtain the equations of motion:
                \[
                    \begin{align}
                        \dot q &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} \\
                        \dot p &= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q}
                    \end{align}
                \]
            </li>
        </ol>
        In our pendulum example, \(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} = p = ml^2\dot\theta\) which means that \(\dot\theta = \frac{p}{ml^2}\).
        Thus the Hamiltonian is:
        \[\begin{align}
            H &= \frac{p^2}{ml^2} - \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\theta}^2 - mgl\cdot cos\theta \\
            &= \frac{p^2}{ml^2} - \frac{1}{2}ml^2\dot{\frac{p}{ml^2}}^2 - mgl\cdot cos\theta \\
            &= \frac{p^2}{ml^2} - \frac{1}{2}\dot{\frac{p^2}{ml}} - mgl\cdot cos\theta \\
            &= \frac{p^2}{2ml^2} - mgl\cdot cos\theta \\
        \end{align}\]
        and the resulting Hamilton equations are:
        \[
            \begin{align}
                \dot\theta &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \frac{p}{ml^2} \\
                \dot p &= -\frac{\partial H}{\partial \theta} = -mgl\cdot sin\theta
            \end{align}
        \]
        From the first equation we can get an alternative expression for \(\dot p\), and then set this equal to the second equation:
        \[
            \begin{align}
                \dot\theta &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p} = \frac{p}{ml^2} \\
                \ddot\theta &= \frac{\dot p}{ml^2} \\
                \dot p &= ml^2\ddot\theta = -mgl\cdot sin\theta \\
                l\ddot\theta &= -g\cdot sin\theta \\
                \ddot\theta &= -\frac{g}{l}\cdot sin\theta
            \end{align}
        \]
        <h2>I talk about things I don't fully understand again</h2>
        Hamiltonian mechanics comes from the same principle of stationary action, though I'm not sure of the math behind it yet...
        The Legendre Transform obtains the Hamiltonian from the Lagrangian, is all I know.
        <br><br>
        Hamiltonian mechanics also has the concept of "phase space": a two-dimensional space with the axes defining momentum \(p\) and a coordinate \(q\).
        <br><br>
        A "flow" on this phase space is a path taken through this space.
        The energy at any point on a specific flow on a phase space is <i>constant</i>.
        For example, these are some of the possible flows on a phase space for our pendulum example:
        <img src="phasespace.png" style="width:100%">
        Notice that the lines that do not connect in a complete loop are cases where the starting momentum is so high that the pendulum flips straight over its pivot and comes around on the other side!
        <!-- <br><br>
        In quantum mechanics, a function (or flow) on a phase space becomes the concept of operators on a state space, and in general, you'll see the Hamiltonian as an operator quite often. -->
        <h2>Canonical Transformations</h2>
        A canonical transformation is a change of variables \(\) in phase space so that Hamilton's Equations still hold:
        \[\begin{align}
            (q, p) &\mapsto (q', p') \\
            \dot q &= \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}, \dot p = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q} \\
            \dot q' &= \frac{\partial H'}{\partial p'}, \dot p' = -\frac{\partial H'}{\partial q'}
        \end{align}\]
        For example, keeping the coordinate \(q\) the same, and momentum is shifted based on coordinate \(q\):
        \(q'=q, p=p+f(q)\).
        <br><br>
        A canonical transformation must preserve Poisson brackets, meaning that
        \[
            \{q_i, q_j\}=0, \{p_i, p_j\}=0, \{q_i, p_j\}=\delta_{ij}
        \]
        <div class="mainContent">
            For two functions \(f(q,p,t)\) and \(g(q,p,t)\) in an n-dimensional phase space, the Poisson bracket is:
            \[\{f,g\} = [f,g]_{P.B.}=\sum^n_{i=1}(\frac{\partial f}{\partial q}\frac{\partial g}{\partial p}-\frac{\partial f}{\partial p}\frac{\partial g}{\partial q})\]
            It has the following properties:
            <ul>
                <li>Antisymmetric: \(\{f,g\}=-\{g,f\}\)</li>
                <li>Linear: \(\{af+bg,h\}=a\{f,h\}+b\{g,h\}\)</li>
                <li>\(\{f,\{g,h\}\} + \{g,\{h,f\}\} + \{h,\{f,g\}\} = 0\)</li>
                <li>\(\{fg,h\} = f\{g,h\} + g\{f,h\}\)</li>
