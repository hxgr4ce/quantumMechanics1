      <h1>Properties of the Inner Product</h1>
      <h2>Geometric meaning of the Dot Product</h2>
      The inner product extends the concept of dot products/scalar products of Cartesian coordinate vectors to possibly infinite-dimensional and complex spaces.
      Say that we have vectors \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}1\\0\end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\end{pmatrix}\) in \((\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R})\), which look like:

      \(\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle = 2\), which is the length of the component of \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) parallel to \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\).
      <br>
      Say instead that \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}2\\3\end{pmatrix}\), in which case our two vectors look like this:
      <svg width=300, height="170">
        <!-- axes -->
        <line x1="10" y1="150" x2="10" y2="10" stroke="gray" stroke-width="1" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
        <line x1="10" y1="150" x2="100" y2="150" stroke="gray" stroke-width="1" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>

        <text x="100" y="30">u</text>

      \(\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle = 7\), which is clearly <i>not</i> the length of the component of \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) parallel to \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\).
      It's actually that length <i>multiplied by the length of \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\)</i>. 
      The length of \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) along \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) is then \(\frac{7}{\sqrt13}\).
      <br><br>
      In our previous example, the length of \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) was 1, so we missed this particular nuance...
      <!-- but this is just how the regular dot product works in general.
      What if instead, \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}i\\0\end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}2i\\1\end{pmatrix}\)?
      <br><br>
      Then \(\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle = -2+0=-2\).
      The vector \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) still has a length of 
      \(
        ||\mid\vec{u}\rangle||
        =\sqrt{\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{u}\rangle}
        =\sqrt{i\cdot-i+0\cdot0}
        =1
      \), 
      so this is saying that our projected length is -2. 
      <br><br>
      In the vector space \((\mathbb{R}^2, \mathbb{R})\), it's obviously not possible to have a negative length-- this is where the scalar product differs from the Cartesian dot product.
      <br><br>
      What if instead,  \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}2i\\3\end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle=\begin{pmatrix}2i\\1\end{pmatrix}\)? 
      <br><br>
      Then \(\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle = -4+3=-1\). 
      The length of \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) is again still what it was in our real example:
      \(
        ||\mid\vec{u}\rangle||
        =\sqrt{\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{u}\rangle}
        =\sqrt{2i\cdot-2i+3\cdot3}
        =\sqrt{13}
      \), 
      but now, the projected length seems to then be \(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{13}}\). 
      Because the first elements of the two vectors are both imaginary, the magnitude of this length seems to be much shorter than its real counterpart. -->
      <h2>The Action of the Inner Product</h2>
      For two vectors \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) and \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) of dimension \(n\), the inner product \(\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) is \(\Sigma_{i=1}^n u_i^*v_i\) for each element \(u_i\) and \(v_i\) in \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) and \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\).
      <h2>The Inner Product of Continuous Functions</h2>
      If we have a continuous function, that is a function that is continuous for all possible inputs, then it must have infinitely many possible output values along the interval on which it is defined.
      We can then represent these continuous functions as infinite-dimensional vector.
      <br><br>
      Given two continous functions, \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) defined along the inerval \([a,b]\), the inner product of their vector representations is: 
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle\vec{f}\mid\vec{g}\rangle &= \int_a^b f^*(x)g(x)dx
        \end{align}
      \]
      Which is essentially the same as the dot product, just defined over a continuous set of possible \(x\).
      <h2 id="orthonormalization">Orthonormal vectors</h2>
        As defined <a href="definitions.html#innerProduct">earlier</a>, two vectors in a vector space \(V\) are orthogonal if they have an inner product of 0.
        A set of vectors \(S=\{\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle\}\) is an orthogonal set of all vectors in \(S\) are orthogonal to all other vectors in \(S\).
        <br><br>
        If each vectors in \(S\) is also normalized (has a length of 1), then \(S\) is an <i>orthonormal</i> set.
        <br><br>
        The most common orthonormalization process (a process which generates a set of orthonormal vectors) is <i>Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization</i>, which follows the following process:
        <ol>
          <li>Pick an arbitrary vector \(\mid\vec{v_1}\rangle\) and normalize it to create:
            \(\mid\vec{e_1}\rangle=\frac{\mid\vec{v_1}\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle\vec{v_1}\mid\vec{v_1}\rangle}}\)
          </li>
          <li>
            Pick a vector \(\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle\) and select its component orthogonal to \(\mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\) (and \(\mid\vec{v_1}\rangle\), since they are parallel):
            \(\mid\vec{v_{2\perp}}\rangle = \mid\vec{v_2}\rangle - \mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\langle\vec{e_1}\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle\). 
            <br><bR>
            Note that since \(\mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\) is normalized, we don't have to account for its length in the term \(\mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\langle\vec{e_1}\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle\).
          </li>
          <li>Normalize \(\mid\vec{v_{2\perp}}\rangle\) to get \(\mid\vec{e_2}\rangle=\frac{\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle - \mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\langle\vec{e_1}\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle - \mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\langle\vec{e_1}\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle\mid\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle - \mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\langle\vec{e_1}\mid\vec{v_2}\rangle\rangle}}\)</li>
          <li>
            Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have all orthonormal vectors. 
            <br><br>
            Note that in step 2, you must select the component of your vector that is orthogonal to <i>all</i> other vectors you have created so far:
            \(\mid\vec{v_{i\perp}}\rangle = \mid\vec{v_i}\rangle - \mid\vec{e_1}\rangle\langle\vec{e_1}\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle- \mid\vec{e_2}\rangle\langle\vec{e_2}\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle-...- \mid\overrightarrow{e_{i-1}}\rangle\langle\overrightarrow{e_{i-1}}\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle\)
          </li>
        </ol>
      <h2 id="schwarz">Schwarz Inequality</h2>
      <div class="mainContent">
        The Schwarz inequality says that for a vector space \(V\):
        \[
          \forall \mid\vec{u}\rangle, \mid\vec{v}\rangle \in V, 
          \mid\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\mid \leq ||\mid\vec{u}\rangle||\cdot||\mid\vec{v}\rangle||
        \]
        or equivalently,
        \[
          \forall \mid\vec{u}\rangle, \mid\vec{v}\rangle \in V, 
          \mid\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\mid^2 \leq \langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{u}\rangle\cdot\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{v}\rangle
        \]
        Essentially this states that the magnitude of the projection of \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) onto some \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) (if \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\) has unit length) must be less than the length of \(\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\).
      </div>
      <p>Derive later...</p>
      <h2 id="triangle">Triangle Inequality</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
          The triangle inequality says that for a vector space \(V\):
          \[
            \forall \mid\vec{u}\rangle, \mid\vec{v}\rangle \in V, 
            || \mid\overrightarrow{u+v}\rangle ||^2 \leq ||\mid\vec{u}\rangle||+||\mid\vec{v}\rangle||
          \]
          Which mirrors the normal geometric triangle inequality.
