        <h1>The Adjoint</h1>
        <p>
            Say that we have the adjoint of linear application \(T: H\to H\) in a finite dimensional space Hilbert space \(H\), called \(T^\dagger\) where:
            \[T^\dagger=(T^T)^*\tag{1}\]
            which acts as:
            \[\langle\vec{v}\mid T\mid\vec{u}\rangle = \langle T^\dagger \vec{v}\mid\vec{u}\rangle = \langle \vec{u}\mid T^\dagger \mid\vec{v}\rangle^*\tag{2}\]
            We say that \(T^\dagger\) maps one vector in \(H\) to another vector in the same space. 
            But what does that actually mean?
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>What it do</h2>
            From what we know about <a href="definitions.html#linearFCN">linear functionals</a>, some vector \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) corresponds to a linear functional \(\langle\vec{v}\mid\).
            <br><br>
            We can see that \(\langle\vec{v}\mid T\) is also a linear functional. 
            If it acts on some input vector \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\): \(\langle\vec{v}\mid T\mid\vec{u}\rangle\), we first obtain \(T\mid\vec{u}\rangle = \mid\vec{u'}\rangle\), 
            then obtain \(\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{u'}\rangle=c\).
            From this action we can see that \(\langle\vec{v}\mid T\) is linear:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    \langle\vec{v}\mid T\mid\vec{u_1}+\vec{u_2}\rangle &= \langle\vec{v}\mid T\vec{u_1}+T\vec{u_2}\rangle \\
                    &= \langle\vec{v}\mid \vec{u_1'}+\vec{u_2'}\rangle \\
                    &= \langle\vec{v}\mid \vec{u_1'}\rangle+\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{u_2'}\rangle \\
                    &= c_1 +c_2 \\
                    &= \langle\vec{v}\mid T\mid\vec{u_1}\rangle+\langle\vec{v}\mid T\mid\vec{u_2}\rangle
                \end{align}
            \]
            and certainly maps a vector in \(H\) to a scalar in its field, so it is a linear functional (in a finite dimensional Hilbert space).
            <br><br>
            (To be a linear functional in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, you have to also be continuous! 
            But we haven't covered that yet...)
            <br><br>
            Mathematically, a bra (e.g. \(\langle\vec{v}\mid\)) which is just a row vector, times a matrix (e.g. \(T\)), yields another row vector, a.k.a. a bra (e.g. the resulting \(\langle\vec{t}\mid\)), which is a linear functional.
            <br><br>
            Anyway, let's write \(\langle\vec{v}\mid T\) as \(\langle\vec{t}\mid\) and say we have <a href="definitions.html#dualcorresp">dual correspondence</a> \(C\).
            We can get the vector corresponding to \(\langle\vec{t}\mid\) by \(C^{-1}\langle\vec{t}\mid\).
            <br><br>
            We have essentially mapped the vector \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) to the vector \(\mid\vec{t}\rangle\) by doing:
            \[\mid\vec{t}\rangle = C^{-1}[C(\mid\vec{v}\rangle) T]\tag{3}\]
            <!-- Another way to say this is that \(T^\dagger \mid\vec{v}\rangle = \mid T^\dagger\vec{v}\rangle = \mid\vec{t}\rangle\). -->
            <hr>
            How do we use the notation \(T^\dagger\)? 
            Since \(T^\dagger\) takes \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) as input and outputs \(\mid\vec{t}\rangle\) via the transformation described in (3), we can write:
            \(T^\dagger\mid\vec{v}\rangle = \mid\vec{t}\rangle\). 
            Taking advantage of ket notation, we can also write this as \(\mid T^\dagger\vec{v}\rangle \), which lets us say the following:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    C\mid T^\dagger\vec{v}\rangle &= \langle T^\dagger\vec{v}\mid \\
                    C\mid\vec{t}\rangle &= \langle\vec{t}\mid =  \langle \vec{v}\mid T \\
                    \langle \vec{v}\mid T &= \langle T^\dagger\vec{v}\mid \tag{4}
                \end{align}
            \]
            So we have \(\langle \vec{v}\mid T = \langle T^\dagger\vec{v}\mid\), which tells us how to use \(T^\dagger\) while working with bra-ket notation.

            <h2>Deriving the Matrix Representation of \(T^\dagger\)</h2>
            From our <a href="linappMat.html">matrix representation of linear applications</a> we know that an element in the matrix looks like \(L_{ki}=\langle\vec{w_k}\mid\hat{L}\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle\), where \(\vec{w_i}\) are the output basis vectors and \(\vec{v_i}\) are the input basis vectors.
            <br><br>The existing \(T\) has matrix elements \(L_{ki}=\langle\vec{w_k}\mid T\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle\). 
            From (4) we know we can write this as \(L_{ki}=\langle T^\dagger\vec{w_k}\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle\). 
            Via the last property of <a href="definitions.html#innerProduct">the inner product</a>:
            \[\langle T^\dagger\vec{w_k}\mid\vec{v_i}\rangle = \langle\vec{v_i}\mid T^\dagger\vec{w_k}\rangle^* = \langle\vec{v_i}\mid T^\dagger\mid\vec{w_k}\rangle^*\]
            Which equates the assertion made in (2) and leads to the definition of \(T^\dagger\) made in (1), where \(T^\dagger\) is the complex conjugate transpose of \(T\).
