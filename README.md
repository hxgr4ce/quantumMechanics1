# Notes from Quantum Mechanics 1, Fall 2025
These are my notes from QM1, both my written notes and a set of webpages for each topic we discussed.

Clone the repository and view each `.html` page locally; I recommend opening `sitemap.html` and using that as a navigational hub from which you can view all webpages and my written notes.

These aren't perfect nor are they close to the excellent verbal instruction from my professor; there are bound to be typos and misunderstandings in my notes. Feel free to contact me about corrections via Github Issue or by email at hu223163@ucf.edu.
