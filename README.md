# Notes from Quantum Mechanics 1, Fall 2025
These are my notes from QM1, both my written notes taken directly from lectures, and a set of webpages which are conceptually organized rather than chronologically organized.

Clone the repository and view each `.html` page locally; I recommend opening `sitemap.html` and using that as a navigational hub, from which you can view all webpages and also see a list of links to my written notes.

These aren't perfect notes, nor are they close to the excellent verbal instruction from my professor; there are bound to be typos and misunderstandings in my notes.
