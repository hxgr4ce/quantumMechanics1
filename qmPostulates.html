      <h1>Quantum Postulates</h1>
      <h2>The Ontological Postulates</h2>
      These define what fundamental objects in our framework are.
      <ol>
        <li>
            <b>A state is a ray (a vector with infinite magnitude) in a complex separable Hilbert space, \(\mid\vec{\psi}\rangle\).</b>
            <br><br>
            This indicates that each of the countable bases in the space represent some identifying physical quality, and we care more about the direction of a ray, rather than the magnitude of a vector.
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Any physical quantity \(\mathscr{A}\) can  be represented as an observable: a self-adjoint, Hermitian operator \(A\) in Hilbert space.</b>
            <br><br>
            (The reverse is also true, all self-adjoint operators \(A\) represent some physical quantity \(\mathscr{A}\).)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>The Measurement Postulates</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <b>The result of measuring a physical quantity \(\mathscr{A}\), is some eigenvalue of the corresponding observable \(A\), \(\lambda\).</b>
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Measuring \(\mathscr{A}\) and observing quantity \(\lambda\) transforms the initial state of the system \(\mid\vec{\psi}\rangle\) into \(\hat{P}_\lambda\mid\vec{\psi}\rangle\), where \(\hat{P}_\lambda\) is the projector to \(\lambda\)'s eigenspace.</b>
            <br><br>
            This means that that initial state is destroyed and totally lost; the only thing that remains is \(\mid\vec{\psi}\rangle\)'s shadow in that eigenspace.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The probabilty of measuring \(\lambda\) is \(\frac{||\hat{P}_\lambda\mid\vec{\psi}\rangle||^2}{||\mid\vec{\psi}\rangle||^2}\).</b> (Born's Rule)
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>The state of an isolated system evolves as a time unitary: \(\mid\psi(t)\rangle=U(t)\mid\psi(t=0)\).</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
