        <h2 id="groups">Groups</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
        A group, G, is a <b><i>set</i></b> with an internal operator + such that
        \[+: G \times G \to G, \quad (a, b) \mapsto a + b\]
        
        The + operator has the following properties:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Associative</b>: 
                \(\forall a, b, c \in G, (a+b)+c = a+(b+c)\)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Neutral Element</b>/Identity: 
                \(\forall a \in G, \exists e_+ \mid a + e_+ = e_+ + a = a\)
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        If a group has the extra property:
        <ul><li><b>Commutative</b>: \(\forall a, b \in G, a+b = b+a\)</li></ul>
        Then it is a commutative or <b><i>abelian</i></b> group.
        </div>
        <br>
        <u>Examples</u>:
        <ul>
            <li>
                \((\mathbb{Z}, +)\), the group of integers equipped with the + operator, is an <b><i>abelian group</i></b> with resepect to +, where \(e_+ = 0\).
            </li>
            <li>\((\mathbb{R}, +)\) and \((\mathbb{C}, \cdot)\) are also <b><i>abelian groups</i></b>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The <a href="planaSym.html">set of planar symmetries of an equilateral triangle</a> is the smallest <b><i>non-abelian</i></b> group.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u>Note 1</u>: I use the symbol + for convenience; if I used \(\cdot\) the definition would be the same-- it applies to <i>any</i> operator which follows the above definition, including addition and multiplication for some sets.</p>
        <p><u>Note 2</u>: \(\mathbb{R}\) and \(\mathbb{Z}\) are <i>not</i> abelian groups with respect to multiplication. The only integers which have symmetric elements that are also integers are 1 and -1, and since 0 exists in \(\mathbb{R}\) and there is no real number \(n \mid n\cdot 0 =1\), \(\mathbb{R}/\{0\}\) is abelian with respect to \(\cdot\) but \(\mathbb{R}\) is not.</p>
        <h2 id="fields">Fields</h2>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><u>Note 1</u>: A field \(F\) is a set which is an abelian group with respect to +, and \(F/\{0\}\) is abelian group with respect to \(\cdot\).</p>
        <p>
            <u>Note 2:</u> In quantum mechanics, we want to work with fields (as they're equipped with useful operators that behave as defined above). 
            So why don't we work with \(\mathbb{Q}\) or \(\mathbb{R}\)? Why do we work with \(\mathbb{C}\) specifically?
            This is because \(\mathbb{Q}\) and \(\mathbb{R}\) are not <a href="rqCompleteness.html">complete</a>.

        <h2 id="conjugate">The Complex Conjugate Transpose</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            The complex conjugate transpose of an \(m\times n\) matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) is:
            \[\mathbf{A}^\dagger=\mathbf{A}^{T*}\]
            where \(^T\) indicates a matrix transpose and \(^*\) indicates that the complex conjugate of each element is taken.
            This also applies to vectors, essentially single column or row matrices.
        </div>
        <h2 id="innerProduct">Inner Product Spaces</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            <p>An inner product/scalar product space is a vector space, V, over a field F, that also has an operator called the inner product or scalar product \[\langle\cdot\mid\cdot\rangle: V \times V \to F, (a, b) \mapsto \langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{b}\rangle\] with the following set of properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    \(\forall \vec{a}, \in V, \langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{a}\rangle \geq 0, \langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{a}\rangle \in \mathbb{R}, \langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{a}\rangle=0 \iff \vec{a}=\vec{0}\)
                </li>
                <li>\(\forall \vec{a}, \vec{b}, \vec{c} \in V, \forall \alpha, \beta \in F, \langle\vec{c}\mid\alpha\vec{a}+\beta\vec{b}\rangle = \alpha\langle\vec{c}\mid\vec{a}\rangle+\beta\langle\vec{c}\mid\vec{b}\rangle\)</li>
                <li>\(\forall \vec{a}, \vec{b} \in V, \langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{b}\rangle= \langle\vec{b}\mid\vec{a}\rangle^*\)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p><u>Note 1</u>: Following from the fact that \(\forall \vec{a}, \vec{b} \in V, \langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{b}\rangle= \langle\vec{b}\mid\vec{a}\rangle^*\), we see that the scalar product is anti-linear in the second entry:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                \langle\alpha\vec{a}+\beta\vec{b}\mid\vec{c}\rangle & = \langle\vec{c}\mid\alpha\vec{a}+\beta\vec{b}\rangle^*\\
                & =(\langle\vec{c}\mid\alpha\vec{a}\rangle+\langle\vec{c}\mid\beta\vec{b}\rangle)^*\\
                & =(\alpha\langle\vec{c}\mid\vec{a}\rangle+\beta\langle\vec{c}\mid\vec{b}\rangle)^*\\
                & =\alpha^*\langle\vec{a}\mid\vec{c}\rangle+\beta^*\langle\vec{b}\mid\vec{c}\rangle
                \end{align}
            \]
        </p>
        <p><u>Note 2</u>: If the vector space is some \(\mathbb{R}^n\), the scalar product is the same as the dot product.
        </p>
        <p><u>Note 3</u>: With the scalar product, we have introduced a sense of geometry by by introducing relationships between vectors.
            For example, if two vectors \(\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in V\) have an inner product of 0, they are <b>orthogonal</b> (perpendicular). 
            We can also induce the <b>norm</b> with the scalar product, which means we can also calculate the distance between vectors and the magnitude of vectors.

        <h2 id="linearFCN">Linear Functionals</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            In a vector space \((V, F)\), linear functional \(f:V\to F\) maps elements of a vector space to elements in its field.
            <br><br>
            We can generate a specifc linear functional from \(\vec{u} \in V, f_{\vec{u}}\), which takes a vector \(\vec{v} \in V, f_{\vec{u}}\vec{v} \mapsto \langle\vec{u}\mid(\mid\vec{v}\rangle)=\langle\vec{u}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\).
            This corresponds to a scalar product where \(\vec{u}\) is always in the first entry.
        </div>
        <h2 id="braket">Bra-Ket Notation</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            Bra-ket notation is used in complex vector spaces.
            <br><br>
            A bra looks like \(\langle f\mid\). It's the linear functional\(f:V\to \mathbb{C}\) for vector space \((V, \mathbb{C})\).
            <br><br> 
            A ket looks like \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\). It is a vector, \(\vec{v}\), in vector space \((V, \mathbb{C})\), and is used to represent a physical state of some quantum system.
        </div>
        <p><u>Note</u>: You don't have to write the vector arrows over the elements in bra-ket notation like I do, but it is nice to differentiate between vectors and other terms that might be in there, e.g. operators/linear applications.</p>
        <h2 id="operators">Operators</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            In quantum mechanics, physical states are represented by vectors. 
            An operator is a function that maps one vector space to another (which is possibly the same space), 
            meaning that one physical state is mapped to another.
            <br><br>
            Observables are a more specific type of operator, which will be defined as a quantum postulate later.
        </div>
        <h2 id="linearApp">Linear Applications</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            <p>Say \(V\) and \(W\) are vector spaces over the same field \(F\). A linear application \(\hat{L}\) is a funtion \(\hat{L}:V\to W, \vec{v} \mapsto \hat{L}\vec{w}\) with properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\(\forall \vec{u}, \vec{v} \in V, \hat{L}(\vec{u}+\vec{v})=\hat{L}\vec{u}+\hat{L}\vec{v}\)</li>

        <h2 id="dualspace">Dual Spaces</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            The set of all linear functionals from \(V\) to \(F\) is itself a vector space called a dual space, \(V^*=\{f: V \to \mathbb{C}\}\).
            Each vector space \(V\) has a dual space \(V^*\), and \(V^*\) itself is a vector space, since \(\forall f, g \in V^*, \forall \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}, (\alpha f + \beta g \mid \vec{v}\rangle = \alpha f\mid\vec{v}\rangle+\beta g \mid\vec{v}\rangle\) (this comes from how \(+\) and \(\cdot\) are defined for \(V^*\)).
        </div>
        <h2 id="dualcorresp">Dual Correspondence</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            A dual correspondence is a linear application that maps a vector space \(V\) to its dual space \(V^*\): 
            \[C: V \to V^*, \mid\vec{v}\rangle \mapsto f_{\vec{v}}\]
            and by the <a href="definitions.html#riesz">Riesz Representation Theorem</a>, \(f_{\vec{v}}=\langle\vec{v}\mid\).
            <br><br>
            \(C\) is also anti-linear:
            \[C(\alpha\mid\vec{v}\rangle + \beta \mid\vec{w}\rangle) = \alpha^*\langle\vec{v}\mid + \beta^*\langle\vec{w}\mid\]
            and invertible:
            \[C^{-1}:V^*\to V, f_{\vec{v}} \mapsto \mid \vec{v}\rangle\]
            and \(dim(V)=dim(V^*)\).
        </div>
        <p>
            <u>Note</u>: The <a href="definitions.html#riesz">Riesz Representation Theorem</a> shows that every bra in a dual space has a corresponding ket in the non-dual space, allowing us to <a href="riesz.html#correspprops">prove the above properties of \(C\)</a>.
        </p>
        <h2 id="riesz">Riesz Representation Theorem</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            In a finite-dimensional space, <i>every</i> linear functional \(f: V \to F\) in vector space \(V, F\), has a corresponding <i>unique</i> vector \(\mid\vec{v_f}\rangle\) such that \(f(\mid \vec{u}\rangle)=\langle\vec{v_f}\mid\vec{u}\rangle, \forall \mid\vec{u}\rangle \in V.\)
        </div>
        <p>
            <u>Note</u>: Click <a href="riesz.html">here</a> for the demonstration that this is true.
        </p>
        <h2 id="norm">Norm</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            A norm is a function on a vector space \((V, F), f: V \to \mathbb{R}, \vec{v} \in V \mapsto ||\vec{v}||\) that describes the magnitude or length of a vector.
            <br><br>
            You may have seen it defined as Euclidean distance, but typically it is defined with the inner product: 
            \[||\vec{v}||=\sqrt{\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{v}\rangle}\]
        </div>
        <h2 id="hilbert">Hilbert Space</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            A Hilbert space is an inner product space that is also a <a href="rqCompleteness.html#metricIncompleteness">metric space</a> with respect to distance induced by the <a href="#norm">norm</a>.
            As a result, unlike Euclidean space (which is at most three-dimensional), it can describe infinite dimensional spaces.
            <br><br>
            A Hilbert space space is <i>separable</i> if and only if it has a countable orthonormal basis. 
        </div>
        <p>
            <u>Note</u>: Most of the Hilbert spaces in quantum mechanics are separable, thus are all isomorphic to each other.
            (This means the <a href="vectorSpaceFeatures.html#basis">basis</a> of one space can be mapped to any basis of another. 
            And since they're infinite dimensional and have a countable basis, this means their bases are countably infinite!)
            <br><br>
            So some people call all infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert space "the Hilbert space" or just "Hilbert space".
        </p>
        <h2 id="adjoint">Adjoint</h2>
        <div class="mainContent">
            Say we have a linear application \(T: H\to H\) that specifically maps from and to the <i>same</i> finite dimensional space Hilbert space \(H\).
            <br><br>
            The adjoint (or Hermitian conjugate) of \(T\) is another linear application called \(T^\dagger\) where:
            \[T^\dagger=(T^T)^*\]
            which acts as:
            \[\langle\vec{v}\mid T\mid\vec{u}\rangle = \langle T^\dagger \vec{v}\mid\vec{u}\rangle = \langle \vec{u}\mid T^\dagger \mid\vec{v}\rangle^*\]
            Meaning that \(T^\dagger\) maps a vector \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) (corresponding to linear functional \(\langle\vec{v}\mid\)) to a totally different vector \(\mid\vec{u}\rangle\).
            <br><br>
        </div>
        <p></p>
        <div class="mainContent">
            If an application \(T\) is <a href="definitions.html#hermitian">Hermitian</a> and \(T=T^\dagger\), it is "self-adjoint". 
            This requirement for \(T=T^\dagger\) means that the domain of \(A\) has to equal the domain of \(A^\dagger\).

            <u>Note 1</u>: Click <a href="adoint.html">here</a> for a more in depth understanding of the action of \(T^\dagger\).
            <br><br>
            <u>Note 2</u>: 
                I don't think only linear applications \(T:H\to H\) can have adjoints, I think any \(T:H_1\to H_2\) can have an adjoint.

            \[P = P^\dagger\]
            and idempotent:
            \[PP=P\]
            Typically they look like \(\mid\vec{p}\rangle\langle\vec{p}\mid\), so that when it acts on a vector \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\):
            \[\mid\vec{p}\rangle\langle\vec{p}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\]
            the <i>length</i> of \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) projected on vector \(\mid\vec{p}\rangle\), <a href="innerProduct.html">which is the term \(\langle\vec{p}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\)</a>, is <i>directed along \(\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\)</i>.

            <u>Notes</u>:
            Projectors as we have defined them here (specifically with the first property that \(P=P^\dagger\)) are mutually orthogonal. 
            This means that any two projectors \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) project to orthogonal  spaces \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) where \(V_1\cap V_2=\{\vec{0}\} \). (Why?)

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Say \(\{\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\}\) is an orthonormal basis and linear application \(A=\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\)
                    <br>
                    \(A\) is self adjoint:
                    \[
                        \begin{align}
                            A^\dagger\mid\vec{v}\rangle &= \mid A^\dagger\vec{v}\rangle \\
                            &= C^{-1}(\langle A^\dagger\vec{v}\mid) = C^{-1}(\langle\vec{v}\mid A) \\
                            &= C^{-1}(\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid) \\
                            &= \langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle^*\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle \\
                            &= \mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle^* \\
                            &= \mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{v}\rangle \\
                            &= A\mid\vec{v}\rangle 
                        \end{align}
                    \]
                    since \(C^{-1}\) is anti-linear and \(\langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\) is a scalar value.
                    <br>
                    \(A\) is also idempotent:
                    \[
                        \begin{align}
                        AA\mid\vec{v}\rangle &= \mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{v}\rangle \\
                        &= \mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{v}\rangle \\

                        \end{align}
                    \]
                    Since \(\{\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\}\) is an orthonormal basis, all \(\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle = 1\) (and all \(\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{e_j}\rangle = 0, i\neq j\)).

                    Say \(\{\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\}\) is an orthonormal basis and linear application \(B=\sum_{i}\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\)
                    <br>
                    For the same reasons as the previous example, \(B\) is self-adjoint.
                    <br>
                    \(B\) is also idempotent:

            Given an orthonormal basis of vectors \(\{\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\}\), an arbitrary vector \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) can be written as:
            \[\mid\vec{v}\rangle=\sum_i c_i\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\]
            This basically means that an arbitrary vector has some length \(c_i\) along each direction described by each \(\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\) in the basis.
            <br><br>
            We can also think of this <i>length</i> \(c_i\) as the component of \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) along \(\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\), which is the scalar product <a href="innerProduct.html">\(\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\)</a>.
            This allows us to rewrite \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\) as:
            \[
                \begin{align}
                    \mid\vec{v}\rangle &= \sum_i \langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\mid\vec{e_i}\rangle \\
                    &= \sum_i \mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid\vec{v}\rangle
                \end{align}
            \]
            implying that \(\sum_i \mid\vec{e_i}\rangle\langle\vec{e_i}\mid = \mathbb{I}\).

            If linear application \(A\) for a vector space \(V\) satisfies this condition:
            \[A\mid\vec{v}\rangle = \lambda\mid\vec{v}\rangle, \langle\vec{v}\mid\vec{v}\rangle\neq0\]
            then it has a set of eigenvalues \(\lambda\) and corresponding eigenvectors \(\mid\vec{v}\rangle\).
            <br><br>
            To find the eigenvalues of \(A\), solve:
            \[\mid A-\lambda\mathbb{I}\mid=0\]
            And then solve the above equation with the obtained \(\lambda\)s to get corresponding eigenvectors.
            Note that by definition an eigenvector cannot be \(\mid\vec{0}\rangle\).
            <hr>
            An eigenspace corresponds to an eigenvalue \(\lambda\), and is the space spanned by \(\lambda\)'s corresponding eigenvectors. 
            That is, the space of all vectors generated by every possible linear combination of \(\lambda\)'s eigenvectors:
            \[V_\lambda=\{\mid\vec{u}\rangle \in V \mid A\mid\vec{u}\rangle =\lambda\mid\vec{u}\rangle\}
            \]
            where the degeneracy of that \(\lambda\) is the dimension of its corresponding eigenspace.
            <br><br>
            Conceptually, \(A\) maps all vectors in some eigenspace \(\lambda\) back to the same eigenspace.
            You can say that <i>within that eigenspace</i>, \(A\) acts like a scaled \(\mathbb{I}\).
            <br><br>
            Note that the sum of all eigenspaces equals the space \(V\) for <i>operator</i> \(A:V\to V\), and all distinct eigenspaces are orthogonal to each other, so
            \[V = \bigoplus V_\lambda\] 
            <hr>
            The spectrum of \(A\) is simply the set of all of its unique eigenvalues:
            \[\sigma_A=\{\lambda \mid \exists\mid\vec{u}\rangle \in V, A\mid\vec{u}\rangle=\lambda\mid\vec{u}\rangle\}\]
