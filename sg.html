      <h1>The Stern-Gerlach Experiment</h1>
      <h2>Initial Motivation</h2>
      <p>
        The Stern-Gerlach experiment (summarized reductively) involved shooting a beam of silver atoms through a magnetic field.
        <br><br>
        Silver has the following electron configuration: 
        \[[Ag]=[Kr]4d^{10}5s^{1}\]
        meaning that the outermost electron is alone in its shell.
        <br><br>
        If a silver atom has a magnetic moment caused by its single outer electron, it will accelerate in a non-uniform magnetic field just like a magnetic dipole.
        <br><br>
        (A magnetic dipole is any system that produces a magnetic field that is equivalent to the field produced by two magnetic poles.
        A magnetic dipole then has a magnetic <i>moment</i>, a vector that describes the strength and direction of the dipole's field.)
        <br><br>
        Classically, we expect this electron can orbit in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, resulting in <i>two</i> different possible orbital angular moments for the atom as a whole.
        However, we don't control of the orientation of the atoms as a whole, they should accelerate every which way in a non-uniform magnetic field, forming a spread out blob.
        <br><br>
        (For more information, <a href="https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/56/12/53/632269/Stern-and-Gerlach-How-a-Bad-Cigar-Helped-Reorient">“Stern and Gerlach: how a bad cigar helped reorient atomic physics,”</a> by Friedrich and Herschbach was an interesting read... I'm really not a reliable source of information on the history...)
        <br><br>
        But, it turned out that the beam of atoms split in two distinct blobs, not one!

      <h2>The Experiment</h2>

      <p>
        The magnetic field must be non-uniform so that the a magnetic dipole will accelerate in it.
        Thus they designed a magnetic apparatus as depicted in <i>Fig. 1</i>, with a wedge-shaped north pole and a U-shaped south pole, so that the field is denser near the north pole than the south.
        <br><br>
        The silver atoms are heated in an oven, which has a small hole which allows that allows the silver atoms escape. 
        The beam goes through a collimator and then enters this inhomogeneous magnetic field.
        <br><br>
        Since I've spoiled it, we already know that the beam is split by this magnetic field, and it is split into two <i></i>equal</i> parts.
        It follows that there are two discrete states that an atom can have, which results in this splitting.
        In modern times, we can say that these results are caused by two discrete, <i>intrinsic</i> possible spins of the electron which are not caused by the electron orbiting
        (but they didn't know that at the time the experiment was first done).
        <br><br>
        When the magnetic field is oriented along the positive \(z\) direction, we call these states "up" and "down", or \(\mid S_z,+\rangle\) and \(\mid S_x,-\rangle\). More simply (and more commonly), though, these are called \(\mid+\rangle\) and \(\mid-\rangle\).
        You'll see the beam split no matter how the field is oriented; the positive \(z\) direction isn't special.
        <br><br>
        The states that result in an observed splitting when the magnetic field is oriented in the positive \(x\) direction are called \(\mid S_x,+\rangle\) and \(\mid S_x,-\rangle\), and in the positive \(y\) direction, we have \(\mid S_y,+\rangle\) and \(\mid S_y,-\rangle\).
      </p>
      <h2>Variations</h2>
      <div style="text-align:center">

        <br><i>Fig 2.</i> Variations on the Stern-Gerlach Experiment. From <i>Modern Quantum Mechanics, Third Edition</i> , by J. J. Sakurai and Jim Napolitano.
      </div>
      <p>
        <b><i>Variation 1.</i></b>
        Instead of passing the beam of atoms through a single magnetic field, say we have two magnetic apparatuses, both oriented in the positive \(z\) direction,
        as in <i>Fig 2a.</i>
        After the first magnetic field splits the beam, <i>we only keep the atoms from the upper "blob"</i>, which are the atoms in state \(\mid S_z,+\rangle\).
        <br><br>
        If we pass this filtered beam through another magnetic field along the positive \(z\) direction, as expected, we see a singular blob, located in the same place where only \(\mid S_z,+\rangle\) atoms would land.
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Variation 2.</i></b>
        What if we instead pass the filtered beam of \(\mid S_z,+\rangle\) atoms through a magnetic field oriented along the positive \(x\) axis, as in <i>Fig 2b</i>?
        <br><br>
        We see an equal amount of atoms being split into two blobs along the \(x\) axis, as one might classically expect, since the orientation of a magnetic moment in the \(z\) direction has nothing to do with how it is oriented in the \(x\) direction.
        <br><br>
        <b><i>Variation 3.</i></b>
        If we filter out only \(\mid S_z,+\rangle\) atoms with the first magnetic field, then <i>further</i> filter the beam with a second magnetic field so it only contains \(\mid S_x,+\rangle\) atoms, we expect the resulting beam to contain only atoms that are in the \(\mid S_z,+\rangle\) and \(\mid S_x,+\rangle\) states, see <i>Fig 2c</i>.
        <br><br>
        If we pass this resulting beam through another magnetic field along the \(z\) axis, however, <i>we again observe half of the beam being deflected upwards, and half of the beam deflected downwards</i>, indicating that there are still atoms in state \(\mid S_z,-\rangle\) in the beam!
      </p>
      <h2>Interpreting the Results</h2>
      Filtering the beam to only contain \(\mid S_x,+\rangle\) atoms with the second magnetic field in variation 3 <i>completely destroys any previous information about the spin in the \(z\) direction</i>.
      We are uncovering some of the <a href="qmPostulates.html">postulates of quantum mechanics</a>, or properties about the state of these systems which are inherent to the systems themselves.
